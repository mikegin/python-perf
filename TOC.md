## How we measured
- rdtsc

## Tests:
- string comparison
- different shapes
- functional methods
- indirection
- cache misses
- large objects
- eval
- strings
- specialization
- data structures

### Python specific
- list comprehensions vs regular loops
- float vs int

## Going further
- how fast can we theoretically go? how close can we get? (bring in rdtsc here)
- dropping to C
- loop unrolling
- instruction level parallelism and breaking dependencies
- SIMD
- multithreading

## Benchmarking tools
- Scalene

## Closing thoughts
- as romgrk says, always benchmart. A wise man once told me: measure twice, cut once
